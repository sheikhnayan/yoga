										<p class="p-big">Infrared is a natural form of heat and radiation. Light comes down to us in waves. Different wave lengths also have
										colours. We can see some of the colours of light with our eyes. However, there are large parts of the colour spectrum
										that are invisible to our eyes, such as Infrared. This falls just after red and is much hotter.</p>
										<p class="p-big">It cannot be seen by the naked eye, but it can be ‘felt’ as heat. Scientists have developed cameras to see the Infrared
										on the bodies of animals, humans and other things. Infrared Technology is being used in medical and industrial fields
										and is a developing area. Infrared Yoga™ class is tailored for everyone, so that any student of any ability can enjoy
										the tremendous benefits that come from joining. You will be asked at registration if you have any specific medical
										issues as this style is not suitable for pregnant women and anyone who has had a recent surgery.</p>
										<p class="p-big">Even if you are not experiencing any kind of pain, Infrared remains a technology that helps the body detox and provides
										an excellent way to purify the skin and organs, muscles, tissues and cells. This in turn helps keep the body and immune
										system working efficiently and effectively. This technology allows the body to accelerate the process of detoxification
										and purification. Delivering all the benefits of health and wellness that come through practising Yoga generally,
										together with cutting-edge Infrared technology is an overall tonic for good health. Come along to a class and experience
										Infrared Yoga yourself.</p>
										<p class="p-big">Every year millions of people try to lose weight, improve their beauty, tone their bodies, purify their skin, detox and
										related goals. Infrared Yoga is a tried and tested method to achieve all of these objectives. The ancient Yogis devised
										a system of purification and cleansing of the body, internally and externally. They also devised a system of colour
										therapy and each major chakra (energy centre) in the body was associated with a colour. The use of colour as an aid to
										preventing mental and bodily imbalances and for healing them is an ancient tradition.</p>
