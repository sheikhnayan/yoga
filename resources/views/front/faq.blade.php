									<h3>Q: How large are the classes?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: At any one time, 30 students can be taught in one class. Your teacher will run through and take you through each of
											the postures assisted by other Yoga practitioners offering help and advice as and when required. One to one classes can
											also be arranged.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: How hot are the classes? What is the temperature of the Infrared during the yoga class?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: This can vary between 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit depending on the class size.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: What if I cannot do the posture?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Appropriate adjustments and modifications will be suggested by your yoga teacher.
										</p>
									  </div>
									  <h3>Q: I am a complete beginner – can I still join a class?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Yes. Your teacher will help plan the session for you.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: I want to only lose weight – is it worth me trying Infrared Yoga?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Yes. Studies show that it helps burn calories in a safe and natural way. So yes, it can help you lose weight.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: What beauty benefits are there in doing this kind of Yoga?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Too many to list here. But it certainly helps keep the skin glowing. Infrared helps to release, dislodge and remove
											toxins, debris and related things that lie under the skin. This in turn helps purify and give the skin a natural
											cleansing routine.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: Are the Infrared Panels in the Yoga studio safe to use?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Yes. They are properly fitted and installed according to Industry specifications and standards.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: Is Infrared the same as Bikram and Hot Yoga styles?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Infrared is not the same as Hot or Bikram styles of yoga. These have their own benefits. You can find out more about
											these other styles of yoga that use ‘heat’ as basis of their practice by contacting one of their studios. Infrared uses
											a different type of heat that is not circulated in the environment. The waves from Infrared penetrate the body directly
											and allow for immediate and gentle way to heat up the body. Combined with practising the syllabus designed by a
											world-leading authority on yoga, you should experience noticeable benefits to your health if not immediately, then
											definitely after a few sessions.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: Do I need any special equipment?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Just make sure to wear clothes that are not too large or flowing. You will need to stretch and bend and it will
											slowly get warmer so you don’t want to be bogged down with extra weight. You can bring a bottle of water with you or buy
											one at the studio to keep you hydrated.
										</p>
									</div>
									  <h3>Q: Is Infrared the same as UV light and if so, isn’t that dangerous to the body?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											A: Infrared is not the same as Ultra Violet light which is emitted by the Sun. Too much exposure to UV can cause damage
											to the skin. Infrared is a natural source of heat. Almost everything on the planet and even the sun emits some form of
											Infrared light. You cannot see it with the naked eye, but it exists. Technological developments mean that you can use
											special cameras to take photographs of the Infrared waves that a person’s body gives out. This kind of technology is
											being used in surveillance to detect when someone is in the ‘dark’ (night) and cannot be detected using traditional
											means. Some animals can see Infrared waves without any help. But as humans we cannot see it with our visible eyes, but
											we can certainly feel it.
